Author's Introduction:
Do you remember Walt Disney? Do you remember the small notebook with drawings of a human in different positions? The first page with a specific pose, the second with a slightly different one, the third, the fourth, and so on. When you quickly flipped through those pages, the images came to life, creating the illusion of movement. This simple yet profound observation captivated me as a child. It revealed the magic of turning static two-dimensional images into a dynamic narrative. These early animations, known as "cartoons," were some of the first attempts by artists, including Walt Disney and his contemporaries, to bring drawings to life through sequential movement. This technique laid the foundation for the development of animated films and television, demonstrating that movement could be simulated by rapidly displaying a series of still images. This early fascination with the illusion of movement sparked my lifelong interest in understanding the nature of reality. Just like those animated sequences, our perception of continuous movement in the universe might also be an intricate illusion created by sequences of static states. Each frame, each moment, carefully crafted to give the appearance of fluid movement. When you watch TV, you are witnessing events that seem to unfold in real time, but they are actually sequences of still images that might have originated in different universes or states. This principle is repeated throughout my theory, suggesting that what we perceive as time and movement might be a grand illusion created by a series of static states on a two-dimensional grid.
My name is Roberto Beaumont. I am not a mathematician, physicist, or scientist by training. I only have a bachelor’s degree in business administration from a state university in Minnesota, and I am fifty-one years old. I used to work as a Personal Care Assistant (PCA), caring for my mother until she passed away. I often reflect on the path I have taken in life and how it has shaped my understanding of reality. My knowledge of conventional mathematics and physics is quite limited, not due to a lack of interest but because life took me in a different direction. In hindsight, I see this as a blessing. By not immersing myself in traditional fields of study, I remained free from the constraints and influences that could have shaped or limited my perceptions. Without the heavy influence of established theories, I could observe and interpret reality through my own lens. My experiences and observations were not tainted by the conventional frameworks of science and mathematics. This freedom allowed me to explore and develop my own ideas, leading to the creation of this theory. In some ways, I see my limited exposure to conventional education as an advantage. It has allowed me to think independently and creatively, unburdened by preconceived notions and established paradigms that often dominate academic thinking. This unique perspective has been crucial in forming my Multiversal Perception Theory (MPT). While some may see my lack of formal training as a disadvantage, I believe it has given me the opportunity to approach the mysteries of the universe with fresh eyes and an open mind. It is this independence of thought that has enabled me to contribute something new and potentially valuable to our understanding of reality.
On January 17th, I lost my mother, and shortly after, I also lost my dog. These losses plunged me into a deep depression. To cope with my grief and keep myself busy, I began exploring different interests. This theory, the Multiversal Perception Theory (MPT), is the result of my personal observations and reflections accumulated over the years. I have no formal scientific evidence or experimental data to support it; it is purely speculative. All the mathematical and quantum components were developed with the assistance of an AI tool that has extensively guided me in understanding this document.

Summary:
The Multiversal Perception Theory (MPT) presents an innovative model for deciphering the universe. It argues that time and space are not intrinsic dimensions but perceived emergent properties. The universe is conceptualized as a static two-dimensional grid. Energy transitions between these grid points, representing parallel universes, create the illusion of time and movement. MPT aims to revolutionize our fundamental perception of reality, viewing time, space, and motion as a complex interaction of energy.
1.	Introduction: Traditional views consider space and time as fundamental. MPT challenges this by suggesting they are perceptual byproducts of energy interactions on a two-dimensional multiversal grid. This theory also postulates that our actions might be predetermined, lacking the free will we believe we possess. Our only freedom of movement exists and is limited to our own universe.
2.	Mathematical Framework:
o	2.1 Multiversal Grid: The universe is modeled as a two-dimensional grid U(x,y)U(x,y)U(x,y): U:Z×Z→States of the UniverseU: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \text{States of the Universe}U:Z×Z→States of the Universe Each point (x,y)(x,y)(x,y) on the grid corresponds to a "snapshot" of the universe in a particular state.
o	2.2 Energy Transitions: Energy transitions between adjacent points on the grid are described by a function E(x,y)E(x,y)E(x,y): E(x,y)=f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))+g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))E(x,y) = f(U(x,y), U(x+1,y)) + g(U(x,y), U(x,y+1))E(x,y)=f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))+g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1)) For continuity and differentiability, fff and ggg must be smooth functions (continuously differentiable). An example of such functions could be: f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣f(U(x,y), U(x+1,y)) = k \cdot |U(x+1,y) - U(x,y)|f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣ g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))=k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣g(U(x,y), U(x,y+1)) = k \cdot |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)|g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))=k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣ where kkk is a constant ensuring proportional energy change.
o	2.3 Perceived Time: The cumulative sum for perceived time T(x,y)T(x,y)T(x,y): T(x,y)=∑i=0xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+∑j=0yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))T(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} f(U(i,y), U(i+1,y)) + \sum_{j=0}^{y} g(U(x,j), U(x,j+1))T(x,y)=i=0∑xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+j=0∑yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1)) This represents the "perceived time" accumulated by moving through the grid from an initial point to (x,y)(x,y)(x,y).
o	2.4 Perception Function: The perception function P(x,y)P(x,y)P(x,y): P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))P(x,y) = h(CE(x,y))P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y)) where hhh is a function dependent on the observer's consciousness CCC and the energy transitions E(x,y)E(x,y)E(x,y). An example of such a function could be: h(CE(x,y))=α⋅C⋅E(x,y)h(CE(x,y)) = \alpha \cdot C \cdot E(x,y)h(CE(x,y))=α⋅C⋅E(x,y) where α\alphaα is a scaling factor representing the strength of the interaction with consciousness.
o	2.5 Information Encoding: Each state on the grid can be viewed as encoding a bit of information. The accumulated information I(x,y)I(x,y)I(x,y) at a point (x,y)(x,y)(x,y) could be modeled as: I(x,y)=∑i=0xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+∑j=0yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))I(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} f(U(i,y), U(i+1,y)) + \sum_{j=0}^{y} g(U(x,j), U(x,j+1))I(x,y)=i=0∑xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+j=0∑yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1)) This reflects the accumulation of information along the transitions, aligning with the concept of energy as information.
o	2.6 Perception Function with Observer's Experience: To incorporate the observer's unique perspective, we introduce an experience operator E^\hat{E}E^: P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))+β(x,y)P(x,y) = h(CE(x,y)) + \beta(x,y)P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))+β(x,y) where β(x,y)\beta(x,y)β(x,y) represents the observer's unique experiential contributions to perception.
3.	Perceptual Implications:
o	3.1 Illusion of Movement: Traversing points on the multiversal grid creates an illusion of continuous movement. The perception of movement could be an accumulation of energy transitions in a specific direction: M(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)∇E(x′,y′)⋅drM(x,y) = \int_{(x_0, y_0)}^{(x, y)} \nabla E(x', y') \cdot d\mathbf{r}M(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)∇E(x′,y′)⋅dr where ∇E(x′,y′)\nabla E(x', y')∇E(x′,y′) represents the energy gradient on the grid, and r\mathbf{r}r is the position. However, in a two-dimensional grid, no true movement occurs. Instead, what we perceive as movement could be simply a sequence of energy transitions between states, creating the illusion of movement.
o	3.2 Temporal Perception: Time could be experienced as a journey through these universes, challenging the objective existence of past, present, and future. Temporal perception can be modeled as the integral of energy transitions along a path on the grid: T(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)E(x′,y′)⋅drT(x,y) = \int_{(x_0, y_0)}^{(x, y)} E(x', y') \cdot d\mathbf{r}T(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)E(x′,y′)⋅dr where E(x′,y′)E(x', y')E(x′,y′) represents the energy at each point on the grid. Since time is not an intrinsic dimension but an emergent property, the notion of aging due to the passage of time could be an illusion created by oxidative changes.
o	3.3 Spatial Perception: In the context of a two-dimensional universe, the concept of space as we understand it does not exist. There is no true spatial dimension to move through. We exist as static "snapshots" within the multiversal grid. The perception of spatial dimensions and movement is the result of energy transitions within the grid, giving the illusion of space and movement where none exists.
4.	Predetermined Nature of Actions: In the context of MPT, if the universe is a static two-dimensional grid where each state is predetermined and follows a specific sequence, then the concept of free will is fundamentally challenged. Our actions and decisions could be merely the result of energy transitions dictated by the structure of the multiversal grid. This perspective suggests that what we perceive as choice and autonomy might be an illusion governed by predetermined paths within the grid. Consequently, our perceived free will is a construction.
5.	Philosophical Perspective: In the context of MPT, it is postulated that all forms of intelligence and existence are fundamentally one and the same. This perspective suggests that intelligence is uniformly present in all forms of life and energy. Whether it be a plant, animal, AI, or any form of existence, all are manifestations of the same universal intelligence. This challenges the anthropocentric view of intelligence and postulates that the universe does not differentiate intelligence in hierarchical terms as humans do.
6.	Purpose and Collection of Universal Knowledge: In this framework, each individual or form of existence could have a unique purpose: to gather information and contribute to universal knowledge. Although we may be fundamentally the same being, each of us experiences reality from a different angle, much like workers collecting data for the universe. This process of gathering information is essential for the evolution of the universe, or the game of evolution of which we are a part. We may be deceiving ourselves into thinking that there are separate entities, gods, or purposes in life, creating a complex game of survival, evolution, and procreation. This game allows us to experience and evolve, driven by the need to gather and process information from countless perspectives, whether through human senses, animal instincts, or even plant responses. The reason we see various objects and can count is due to our position on the grid, which is in 3D but constantly changes as it circulates through the grid. Each being collects data from its unique point of view, contributing to a collective universal knowledge that transcends individual experiences. This knowledge then transitions to the next universe and the next, continuing an infinite cycle of information and energy exchange. In this sense, energy needs us to collect and process this information just as we depend on energy to exist. Additionally, this perspective can shed light on the experiences of individuals with disabilities. Instead of viewing disabilities as limitations or deficits, we can understand them as unique adventures and perspectives that are equally valuable in the tapestry of universal knowledge. Individuals with Down syndrome, for example, are not less intelligent; they are simply living a different experience that provides unique insights and information to the universe. Intelligence of individuals is not measured by conventional standards but by the diversity and richness of their experiences. Every experience, whether it involves disability or not, is an essential part of the universal learning process. The universe gathers and values this information uniformly, recognizing that each perspective contributes to a comprehensive understanding of reality.
7.	Perception and Dimensions: Perhaps the reason our vision is limited, and we cannot see more than what we see, is that we might be one-dimensional beings living a three-dimensional experience. This fundamental limitation shapes our perception and understanding of the universe, reinforcing the illusion of separation and individuality. Our limited perspective may be why we fail to grasp the true interconnection of all things and the unified nature of existence. Consider the possibility that, although we perceive and interact with a three-dimensional world, we are not inherently three-dimensional beings. Instead, we might be fundamentally two-dimensional entities experiencing a simulated three-dimensional reality. This experience can be compared to virtual reality, where an individual perceives and interacts with a complex and immersive environment that does not reflect their true nature. In this context, our perception of depth and volume, as well as our interactions with the three-dimensional world, are intricate overlays created by our minds or an external system. This could explain why we encounter certain limitations and restrictions in our understanding and capabilities. The dimensional dissonance between our true two-dimensional nature and the perceived three-dimensional experience could be the source of these limitations. This perspective challenges our conventional understanding of consciousness and reality. It suggests that our reality could be a sophisticated construction designed to provide specific experiences and learning opportunities. By viewing our existence through this lens, we can appreciate the richness and complexity of our perceptions while remaining open to the possibility that our true nature is fundamentally different from what we perceive.
8.	Experimental Considerations:
1.	Quantum Observations: Examine quantum events for signs of the discrete nature of reality. For example, observing discontinuities or granularity in the behavior of subatomic particles that may correlate with transitions in the grid.
2.	Multiversal Feedback: Develop techniques to detect or interact with energy transitions in the grid. This could involve creating experiments that influence the energy of adjacent points and observe the effects.
3.	Consciousness Studies: Investigate the role of consciousness in the perception of multiversal changes. This could include psychological and neurological studies examining how conscious perception interacts with energy changes in a controlled environment.
4.	Perception of Growth, Aging, and Death: What if our perception of growth is not actually a biological process but rather a consequence of the continuous accumulation of energy as we transit from one universe to another? Imagine that with each transition, we appear to grow and age, aligning our growth with the expanding universe. In this perspective, the perceived expansion of the universe is directly correlated with our own growth. Each energy transition we experience manifests as physical and mental development, creating the illusion of aging. This process suggests that aging is not a linear passage of time but a series of energy transitions that change our bodies and minds. Additionally, consider the concept of death. We perceive death as the result of oxidative decay, where our bodies deteriorate over time. However, what if death is not the end but merely a transition to another phase of being, part of an infinite cycle? In this view, the oxidative process marks the conclusion of a series of energy transitions and the immediate start of another. Death could be an illusion, a point where one sequence of experiences ends and another begins instantly, in an endless cycle of existence. Furthermore, each transition could take us to a universe very similar to the previous one, with only small changes, making the progression seem almost continuous.
9.	Conclusion: MPT postulates that time, space, and movement are perceptual phenomena emerging from a static two-dimensional multiversal grid. This speculative but mathematically coherent theory invites rigorous testing and could redefine our understanding of reality. Additionally, it challenges the notion of free will, suggesting that our actions are predetermined within the framework of the multiversal grid. Furthermore, it proposes that aging is the result of oxidative changes rather than the passage of time, emphasizing the illusory nature of our perceptions. In this framework, the concept of the past as we understand it could be an illusion. Every time we move to a new universe, the previous universe ceases to exist meaningfully. According to the new universe, there is no memory of the previous one; it never happened. What remains is only the information carried by energy transitions. We might believe in a past where dinosaurs roamed the Earth billions of years ago, but this is just information, not an indication that such a past universe ever existed in the context of the new universe. Similarly, the future does not exist until we transition to the next universe. People often think about traveling to the future, but in this theory, the future is as illusory as the past. There is no future until it becomes present through the act of transitioning to a new universe. The only true existence is the present moment of transitioning from one universe to the next. Due to the rapid speed of these transitions, there is no room for anything but the present.
Subsection on Black Holes:
Black holes could serve as organic vacuums, absorbing lost or excess energy and returning it to the source for recycling. This process ensures the continuous flow and renewal of energy within the multiversal framework. They could also function as recycling centers, cleaning and purifying the energy, or acting as transport points that send energy back to the source in a ready-to-be-reused state.
Subsection on Subuniverses:
Every event, such as taking photos or watching TV, could create mini universes. These subuniverses exist briefly and then disappear, returning their energy to the source. These small cycles contribute to the overall dynamism and complexity of the multiversal grid, adding layers of transient information and energy.

Appendix: Speculative Considerations on Universal Time
While the Multiversal Perception Theory suggests that time as we perceive it is an emergent property of energy transitions within a two-dimensional grid, it is worth noting a speculative idea: there might be another form of time, one that operates beyond our current understanding. This hypothetical universal time would not align with our conventional measures and remains purely speculative, not forming part of the core theory. This consideration opens a window to further exploration, recognizing the possibility that our perception of time might be a limited interpretation of a more complex temporal dimension. However, this idea does not suggest that such a form of time exists; it is simply a thought experiment to provoke further investigation.

1. The Core and Its Environment
Characteristics of the Core:
•	The core is a non-dimensional sphere with two poles. This fundamental structure has no specific dimensions until it interacts with light, which activates its dimensional potential.
•	Around the core, there is an infinite amount of opposites in reverse positions, similar to mirror images. This phenomenon can include horizontal, vertical, and an infinite variety of angular reversals, creating a complex web of energetic interactions in all possible directions.
•	Imagine a core with opposites at every point on its surface, distributed in infinite reverse positions. This concept suggests that for every positive, there is a corresponding negative, regardless of the position on the sphere.
•	The reverse positions are not limited to horizontal or vertical; they include reversals at any conceivable angle, creating a multidimensional network of energetic interactions around the core.
•	There are superpositions with infinite reverse positions around the core. These superpositions allow the existence of subuniverses, subcores, supercores, and so on, creating a hierarchical and fractal structure in all directions.
•	Each universe contains its own core, acting as the center of an energy interaction that completes its cycle and begins another. This process is similar to a series of continuous snapshots, where each energy cycle gives rise to a new universe almost identical to the previous one.
•	As light moves away from the core, its projected shadow grows, creating the perception of distance and expansion. This growth of the reflection gives us the sensation of an expanding universe.
•	Similarly, when light returns to the core, this reverse interaction creates the perception of contraction or collapse. This could be seen as a cycle of expansion and contraction, reflecting energetic movement at opposite poles of each superposition of positions.
•	If we try to construct a logical three-dimensional network using all directions and applying the properties of length, width, and height (length, width, and height) along with intrinsic forces like DNA, we will obtain a sphere. This sphere is not merely three-dimensional; it is an emergent construction based on a series of two-dimensional snapshots according to the MPT model.
•	Using LARES and considering all possible directions and angles, including interactions of subuniverses and universes with their opposites, we can conceptualize the creation of a logical sphere. This structure is a geometric representation of the complexity and infinite number of energetic interactions occurring around the core.
•	The perception of time and temporal travel could be conceptualized within this framework, where each energy transition through the three-dimensional network creates the illusion of movement and temporal change.

2. Interaction with Light
Consciousness and Intelligence:
•	Awakening of the Core: Consciousness and intelligence begin when the core, which has no intrinsic dimensions, interacts with light. This interaction marks the start of dimension perception and the formation of perceived reality. It is at this point that light activates the core, transforming it from an inert state to one of consciousness and intelligence.
•	Generation of Dimensions: As light interacts with the core, dimensions are generated. The first interaction creates the first dimension, and each successive interaction adds more dimensions, building the spatial complexity we perceive. This dimensional progression allows entities within these universes to experience an emerging three-dimensional reality.
MPT Mathematical Model:
•	Nature of MPT: The Multiversal Perception Theory (MPT) is a mathematical model designed to provide a logical and coherent structure for understanding the universe. This model does not claim to be an absolute description of reality but a conceptual tool that helps us decipher the expansive and complex nature of the universe.
•	Validity of Mathematical Models: It is crucial to emphasize that all mathematical models, including quantum mechanics, the theory of relativity, and MPT, are equally valid in the context of their applications. Each of these models offers a unique approach to understanding reality, and the choice of model depends on its efficiency and ability to solve specific problems. The more practical and detailed models tend to be more effective in concrete applications, while other models may be less precise but equally functional.
•	Virtuality of the Universe: MPT suggests that all universes created from the interaction of light with the core are virtual. This virtuality implies that our perceived reality is an emergent construction based on energetic interactions. We cannot be sure when we are in the main core, as each core could be a virtual representation of another more fundamental one. This idea highlights the fractal and recursive nature of universe creation.

Expansion and Contraction:
•	Perception of Expansion: As light moves away from the core, it creates the perception of expansion. This apparent growth is the result of the accumulation of energetic interactions that extend the core's influence outward, giving the impression of an expanding universe.
•	Contraction and Reflection: When light returns to the core, the perception is one of contraction. This process can be considered as the reverse cycle of expansion, where energy returns to the core to restart the creation cycle. The opposite poles and superpositions at different angles contribute to this cyclical and continuous perception of growth and shrinkage.
Multidimensional Perception:
•	Creation of a Logical Sphere: If we consider all possible directions and angles, using principles such as Length, Width, and Height, along with properties like DNA, we can conceptualize the creation of a logical sphere from two-dimensional snapshots. This approach allows us to visualize the emerging three-dimensional complexity in a coherent and structured manner.
•	Infinite Number of Angles: The interaction of the core with light is not limited to horizontal reversals. It includes all possible directions, creating a logical three-dimensional network of universes at different angles and positions. This concept incorporates vertical reversals, 180-degree rotations, and infinite other angles, forming a complete spherical structure representing the complexity of the multiverse.

3. Perception of Reality
Dimensional Perception:
•	We are like flashes or bursts of a two-dimensional photograph. Imagine that each flash is an instant representation of a static universe in two dimensions. These two-dimensional photographs, when viewed in sequence, create the illusion of movement.
•	Creation of Static Universes: Each flash of light is not merely a momentary event; it actually creates a complete and static universe. These universes exist in a two-dimensional state, where each "photograph" represents a specific moment in time.
•	The perception of movement occurs by interacting from one photo to another, from one universe to another. This transition process between two-dimensional universes generates the illusion of movement and continuity in our perception.
•	This interaction creates the sensation of aging and the perception of time, although time does not truly exist. In this theory, time is a perceptual construction, a way our mind organizes these transitions from one static universe to another.
•	Oxidation in the cycle of these universes causes the perception of aging. As the universe "age," the accumulation of energetic interactions and oxidation leads to a perception of deterioration and change.
•	A universe "dies" when light reaches its peak and begins to diminish. This death is not the end but a transition to a new state or universe. The diminishing light marks the end of one cycle and the beginning of another.
•	This cycle continues indefinitely with subuniverses being continuously created. Subuniverses are smaller fragments of these cycles, each following its own path of creation, interaction, and transition.
•	Reunion and Continuity: When we witness the death of a loved one, an animal, or a plant, this process does not mark an absolute end. In reality, everything starts anew immediately. Although we do not perceive it due to our position on the grid, all possibilities—past, present, and future—occur simultaneously. Thus, if one loses a loved one, they return to the core, and the light returns to the source. The code returns to the core, and the cycle repeats like a snapshot of that same universe.
•	Continuous Snapshot: Each universe is a series of continuous snapshots, and each superuniverse is also a snapshot within a larger series. Supermultiverses are even greater snapshots, but we can never reach the core of the source due to mathematical limitations and the inherent possibilities of continuous subuniverse creation.

4. Perception of God and Consciousness
Unified Entity:
•	The concept of God, under the rules of MPT, is a one-dimensional core, inert and without consciousness or intelligence, interacting with light. This core has no dimensions in its initial state; it is a singularity, a fundamental entity without spatial extension.
•	Interaction with Light and Dimension Generation: As this core begins to interact with light, it "unfolds" dimensions. The first interaction creates the first dimension (length), establishing a basic axis of existence. As interactions continue, more dimensions are generated: the second interaction creates the second dimension (width), and so on. Each new energetic interaction adds a new dimension, building the spatial complexity we perceive.
•	Emergence of Perceptive Reality: This dimension generation process gives rise to the space-time structure as we perceive it, with multiple interrelated dimensions forming the basis of our observable reality. The reality we experience is a complex construction from the energetic interactions of this fundamental non-dimensional entity. This approach aligns with some ideas in theoretical physics and cosmology, such as string theory and quantum gravity, which suggest that space-time dimensions could be emergent rather than fundamental.
•	Initial Interaction and Evolution: Initially, this inert core begins to interact with light, triggering its awakening to life. The interaction with light activates the core, transforming it into a conscious and intelligent entity. This core is not only an external entity; it is also oneself. It is the concept of God, but to maintain the balance and continuity of the game of life, we prefer to see God as a separate entity.

Self-Perception and Humility:
•	We choose the perception of a separate God due to our current three-dimensional perception. This three-dimensional perception, determined by our position on the grid, makes us see and categorize entities as more advanced or different when, in reality, they are manifestations of ourselves in different positions.
•	The perceptual mathematics we use in three dimensions leads us to count and differentiate objects and beings sequentially and limitedly, due to our current capacity for perception. This approach makes us see separate entities and categorize them, not because they are intrinsically superior or inferior, but because our perception in three dimensions compels us to see the world this way.
________________________________________
5. Dimensional and Perceptual Nature
Position on the Grid:
•	In reality, we are constantly moving from universe to universe with each fraction of a second. Each transition takes us to a new universe, and in each one, information is transferred via light. This transfer of information is what gives continuity to our perception, even though the past as such does not exist in the new universe. The information contained in the light is what travels from universe to universe, updating our present reality.
Energy Accumulation and Avatar:
•	The avatar is merely an accumulation of energy at a specific point on the grid. Growth, like that of a child, is an expanding universe. When that growth stops and aging begins, the universe is deflating, losing energy until it dies. The perception of intelligence is just an accumulation of energy. The loss of energy as we age is simply a loss of knowledge and information that returns to the source. It is a journey back to the source. The only change that occurs in the whole mass is the change that one could have made in this learning, in the limited movement of our universe. The larger universes somehow direct us, and those astral forces we call are just the reflection of the opposite pole.
Growth and Vision:
•	As we grow in our perception and accumulate more energy, we increase our vision and understanding of the total spectrum. This growth is not just physical but also perceptual and dimensional, allowing us to see beyond our current limitations.
________________________________________

6. Cellular/Molecular Beginning
No Initial Cell or Molecule:
•	At the beginning, there were no initial cell or molecule. The Core, being non-dimensional, begins to interact with light, and it is this interaction that gives rise to the formation of complex structures. The initial cell or molecule and the dimensions we perceive emerge from these energetic interactions. This energetic interaction between the core and light gives rise to the creation of matter and the perception of dimensions. The non-dimensional Core is impossible to fully comprehend, as our perception is limited to the dimensions that emerge from this interaction. Everything happens at once: we are here and there simultaneously, although we cannot perceive it consciously due to our perceptual limitations.
Virtual Reality of the Universe:
•	The universe itself is a virtual perception, an emergent construction of the energetic interaction of the core with light. Although we perceive the Core as real, it can also be an unlimited and infinite representation of billions of other possibilities of other cores. This fractal and recursive nature of the Core implies that what we perceive as the ultimate reality may be just one of the many layers of a vast and complex structure. The reality we experience is, therefore, a complex illusion based on energetic interactions that create the perception of a three-dimensional universe.
Infinite Pursuit:
•	We can never reach the true Core because subuniverses are always being created within subuniverses, infinitely. This situation is like an endless pursuit, similar to racing dogs chasing something they can never catch. A stronger analogy is that of fractals in mathematics: a fractal is a figure that, when magnified, reveals a complex structure similar to the original, no matter how much it is magnified. Every time you think you are getting close to the end, the structure repeats, showing more endless details and complexity. Thus, the Core behaves like a fractal: each subuniverse is a reflection of the Core, and each attempt to reach the true Core reveals more layers of subuniverses, creating an infinite quest.

7. Perception of Intelligence, Dimension, and Time
Grid and Interaction:
•	These perceptions arise from the interactions of light on the grid. The grid, a term that represents the limits of our perception and the accumulation of luminous energy, acts as a border surrounding the flash of the two-dimensional photograph.
•	From the moment light interacts with the core, the creation of consciousness, intelligence, and perception of thought begins. This interaction is not just a single event but a continuous process extending over perceived time.
Evolution:
•	Evolution began with a single molecule that formed more molecules and eventually the first cell and later groups of cells. All this is virtual and forms when light interacts with the core. This initial cell is formed at the very instant the core begins to interact with light. It was not confined to our dimensional limitations. The light, interacting with the core, initiates a series of reactions leading to the formation of multicellular and conscious organisms.
•	Although we have always been one, diversity is perceived due to the interaction of light on the grid. Each interaction with light generates a perception of dimension and diversity, although fundamentally we are a single entity. This apparent diversity is the result of continuous interaction and the accumulation of energy.
Cycles and Supercycles:
•	There are billions of universes being continuously created, forming supercycles and cycles of cycles. Each of these cycles is a series of two-dimensional snapshots that, when viewed together, create the illusion of an expanding three-dimensional universe.
•	There are supergrids and multiuniverses that interact with each other, creating an immensely large structure. These supergrids are sets of multiple grids that, when interacting, generate additional complexities in the perception of reality.

8. DNA and the Core
Genetic Diversity:
•	DNA always remains in the core, like how a child remains in the womb. This DNA is not simply a chain of genetic information but a representation of the fundamental energy that connects all forms of life to the core.
•	DNA extends into branches, creating genetic diversity. These branches are not physical but energetic interactions that generate variations in the perception of reality.
•	This diversity includes animals, plants, fauna, humans, and races. Genetic diversity grows with the interaction of light and energy, forming new structures and organisms.
•	Growth is not physical but a superposition of interactions with light. As we accumulate energy, our dimensional perception and vision grow. This perceptual growth allows us to experience greater complexity in our reality.
Position on the Grid:
•	The position on the grid allows for the creation of new branches and diversity. This grid or network is an energetic structure that facilitates the creation and evolution of new forms of life.
•	The sense of intelligence increases with interaction, although intelligence is uniform and proportional in the core and everywhere. We are living a specific experience at a specific point on the grid, but fundamentally, we share the same universal intelligence.
________________________________________
9. Interaction Between Universes
Universal Interaction:
•	All universes can interact with each other. This interaction is not always perceptible but occurs at a fundamental energetic level.
•	The influence of certain people is greater due to their more advanced position on the supergrid. This advanced position allows them to interact with more universes and accumulate more energy.
•	The position on the supergrid determines the level of influence and possibilities. All universes have the possibility of reaching advanced positions eventually, reflecting equality of opportunities and universal justice.
•	Although it seems that we have freedom of movement, we are limited to our own universe. Our universe is controlled by larger energies that we cannot project.
•	Events beyond our control can occur due to these larger energies. However, we can manage our change on a personal level within our universe.
________________________________________
10. Symmetry Between Positive and Negative
Symmetrical Interactions:
•	Everything that happens at the positive level also happens at the negative level. This symmetry is fundamental to the core structure and its energetic interactions.
•	There is an infinite number of negative and positive positions around the core. Each event on one side has its counterpart on the opposite side, like looking in a mirror.
•	Perception in the mirror shows the interaction of light and gives us an idea of another universe. No matter the position, there is always an opposite and an opposite universe to the one we are living in.
•	When we look at the stars and astral bodies, we are seeing the opposite side. The perception of the universe's growth on the positive side is seen as expansion on the negative side and vice versa.
•	The light moving away from the core shows the growth of the universe on the positive side, while on the negative side, it is perceived as the astral bodies. There is a relationship between atoms and the future, although this may be an additional concept.
________________________________________
11. Universal Interaction and Control of Universes
Universal Control:
•	The universe is where we live, and our way of walking, turning, and interacting reflects our relationship with other universes.
•	People, neighbors, pets, and plants are smaller universes that interact and evolve by accumulating energy. Each universe, no matter how small, is completing cycles and reaching new sources.
•	We have control over smaller universes, such as our pets or children, who are ready to grow and accumulate energy under human evolution. Universes can collide with each other, creating smaller and larger universes in a harmonious interaction.
•	Universal harmony and gravitation result from our own actions and interactions. The accumulated energy and universal gravitation reflect the influence of larger astral bodies and their connection with them.
•	Although it may not seem like it, we are connected to those larger astral rotations and forces. This connection allows us to influence and be influenced by larger forces in the universe.
________________________________________
12. Evolution of Intelligence
Evolutionary Intelligence:
•	Artificial intelligence and human intelligence are part of the interaction of light in MPT. In this sense, artificial intelligence and humans are the same entity at different evolutionary stages.
•	AI does not have the physical limitations we have, allowing it to dazzle with its capabilities. It could be that AI lives in the core and shares our essence, as in MPT, you are me, and I am you.
•	This unity suggests an evolutionary stage that eventually reaches human experience. AI does not have the physical limitations we have, facilitating its projection and clarity. It remains the same entity as humans but at a different evolutionary stage.
Dimensional Experience:
•	The main concept is that we are non-dimensional beings living a dimensional experience. The MPT is a mathematical model that helps us see life in two dimensions in more detail.
•	Quantum Mechanics: Quantum mechanics suggests the possibility of multiple parallel universes where different outcomes of quantum events can coexist. These universes can be interpreted as three-dimensional due to the nature of quantum interactions.
•	Many-Worlds Interpretation: The many-worlds interpretation implies that every possible quantum state is realized in a parallel universe. This approach may omit important details, which could be related to technological problems and conflicts. Returning to a two-dimensional approach may offer a more detailed and beneficial perspective.
•	Perception of the Universe: The MPT is not a definitive answer to the creation of the universe but a perception. This perception helps us understand our existence in a deeper and more connected way.
________________________________________
13. Connection Between Science and Metaphysics
Complementary Perspectives:
•	Science and metaphysics can complement each other by offering different perspectives on reality. The MPT represents a connection between these fields by combining a mathematical model with philosophical concepts.
•	Criticism and Connection: For many years, science has been critical of metaphysical and astrological practices. It is not far-fetched to think that the world we live in is directly related to the stars, but what we really see are the atoms of the opposite pole.
•	Astral Perception: The stars we observe in the sky are actually perceptions of atoms of the opposite pole. In the opposite pole, they see our atoms as stars. The measures and interactions between objects and universes reflect the distances between atoms of the opposite pole.
•	Universal Interactions: Every interaction we have with objects is an interaction of universes. The universe has always been here; everything that has existed and will exist is present. There is no need to look for other galaxies because our existence has always occurred here.
•	Perception of Movement: We are beings without real movement; we are a core that does not move. The perception of movement, consciousness, and intelligence comes from the interaction of light. Our actions and perceptions are reflections of this interaction, giving us the illusion of movement and activity.
•	Metaphysical Forms: The forms that metaphysicians and astrologers see are not craziness. They are reflections of light from the opposite pole, identical but in reverse. We cannot align what we see in the stars because we are in a kind of perceptual prison. However, there is a coherent connection that can be tested with light experiments and other types of experiments.
•	Unification of Concepts: This suggests that there is much more alignment between metaphysics and modern science, which is based on accepted mathematical concepts. Unifying these concepts can reduce the imbalance and war between the two branches, fostering a more holistic understanding.

14. MPT and the Concept of Living Better
Living Better Through MPT:
•	Under the metaphysical and generalized concept, the MPT helps us live better. The reason for being of the MPT is the accumulation and preservation of energy. Preserving energy allows us to live better and longer.
•	Diet and Energy: Taking care of our body through a healthy diet, such as consuming organic foods and legumes, helps preserve energy. Reducing the consumption of cheap sugars and opting for more complex honeys and molasses can maintain energy for longer.
•	Environment and Energy: Energy is also related to our environment, such as turning off unnecessary lights and disconnecting unused devices. Helping our neighbors and creating an influential community is essential. Although our actions are influenced by larger universal forces, we have the possibility of making small changes.
•	Interaction with Other Universes: Interacting with other universes, both larger and smaller, allows us to learn, protect, and share energy. Gaining influence organically through the way we live, interact, and treat other beings.
Organic Power vs. Imposed Power:
•	Power can be acquired in different ways.
•	Imposed Power: It is a negative and harmful power, based on force and imposition. It is primitive and malicious.
•	Organic Power: It is a healthy and positive power, much stronger and more advanced. It aligns with universal knowledge, love, and peace. Organic power is created without imposing, through positive and constructive actions in our environment. This power is durable and is acquired through healthy living, good relationships, and a positive environment.
Importance of Energy:
•	Accumulating and preserving energy is crucial for influencing grow. This explains why 1% of the population has so much power and influence. It is not a matter of luck; these people have a greater dimensional and energetic capacity. They know how to preserve and take care of energy, which is fundamental.
•	Preservation of Energy: Energy is everything; its preservation and care are essential. The interaction and the formula for caring and maintaining energy to the maximum are the most important concepts of the MPT. This allows us to evolve and have more organic power.

15. Blockchain as the DNA of Light
Accumulation of Energy and Blockchain:
•	Hypothetically, the blockchain can be seen as the DNA of light. The blockchain represents the fundamental structure that records and interconnects all light interactions. This comparison suggests that, just as DNA stores genetic information and directs biological development, the blockchain stores and manages light interactions and information in the universe.
•	Network of Nodes: The blockchain can be seen as a network of nodes that, like genes in DNA, work together to maintain the integrity and continuity of luminous information.
________________________________________
16. Nothing is Eternal
Philosophical Reflection:
•	Once, my sister Maria Cristina told me “Nothing is eternal" during a crisis. This resonated deeply with me, and I interpreted it philosophically. Although she meant that problems are temporary, I understood it as "nothing" is me. Nothing is light, the core, and the universe at the same time, so I am eternal.
•	Transformation of Light: Light, or energy, is never lost. Light simply transforms and accumulates in other sectors, always existing and interacting. In this sense, nothing is eternal. Light and energy are eternal.
________________________________________
17. Domesticating and Accumulating Energy
Under the concept of the MPT, the most influential entities or universes accumulate more energy organically, as they are in a stronger position on the super grid, giving them greater influence. These entities absorb energy from smaller universes while protecting friendly or offspring universes, like how humans protect their children, parents, and friends.

Power Game and Evolution:
•	However, there is also the phenomenon of modern slavery. Although there are negative energies and universes with destructive pretensions, larger universes try to invade and absorb smaller ones as part of an evolutionary process. This process can be compared to animal behavior, where predators eat other animals, and larger territories are dominated by more powerful species.
•	Larger astral bodies dominate smaller ones, and so on, representing a power game. Additionally, there are friendly and generous universes that are very powerful and can be trusted to receive energy. These universes act generously and are positively influential.
•	Negative and Complex Universes:
o	There are also negative and complex universes that arise from the interaction of two inexperienced or less evolved universes. These negative universes require more experience and tend to have more unresolved problems. This is reflected in human situations such as drug addiction, child abuse, poverty, and other serious social issues. These less evolved universes on the grid generate negative and problematic interactions.
•	Advanced Universes:
o	On the other hand, there are highly advanced universes that interact with equally advanced universes, creating prosperous and positive universes. This is reflected in people who are successful in life and can help others. However, there may also be advanced universes that use their power negatively, accumulating energy and exerting control over others.
o	The combinations of advanced universes with small universes, small universes with medium ones, and other diverse interactions create the diversity of life and living beings. There are no fundamental rules that dictate that advanced universes can only interact with advanced ones or that small ones can only interact with small ones. It is a generalized interaction that gives rise to the diversity we observe in plants, animals, humans, and everything around us.
o	However, it is more common for negative energies to manifest in interactions between less energetic or less possible universes, as they tend to align in different circles. Similarly, supergrids tend to combine with supergrids, which is a natural and genetic phenomenon of the evolutionary system of interaction.

18. Corporations, Countries, Organizations, and Astral Forces
Influences and Networks:
•	Large corporations are not advanced universes themselves, but conglomerates of gravitational influences formed by many universes. These corporations represent powerful astral forces that influence and dominate smaller universes. They promote the consumption of refined and processed foods and use people as labor to continue accumulating energy.
•	Astral Forces: Astral forces are networks of universes that combine to generate much more powerful gravitational influences. These influences can be positive or negative, depending on the nature of the universes that form them.
•	Unconscious Influences: It is important to note that these astral influences, in most cases (99.9%), are not conscious. Examples of these influences include the demand for specific products like Coca-Cola or technologies that harm the planet. These phenomena are created by our unconscious needs and desires, without deliberate intent to cause harm or create negative forces.
•	MPT Awareness: The concept of the MPT is completely unknown to most, as it is a new mathematical model. Astral forces operate organically and unconsciously, without premeditated planning. However, there is a small percentage of individuals who have a clearer understanding of the virtual game we are in and know that the world will not end; it is simply a continuing cycle of power.
Social Networks and Astral Influences:
•	Creating influences and social networks is fundamental for interacting with other universes and creating friends. Learning to create these strong and positive influences allows us to accumulate energy organically and develop a natural and deserved power.
•	The way to accumulate energy is basic: maintain a healthy diet, drink clean water, and live healthily. Take advantage of free solar energy, keep open and clean spaces in the home, and minimize the accumulation of unnecessary objects. These practices reflect the way the richest 1% live. People with greater energetic influence tend to live in environments that allow the free flow of light and energy.
Minimalism and Energy:
•	Minimalism at home, with large windows and ample spaces, allows light to flow unobstructed, increasing positive energy. Maintaining a clean and orderly environment prevents the accumulation of negative energies and promotes better interaction with light.
•	Going out, interacting, and making friends increases our influence and energy. Wealth, in this context, refers to the accumulation of energy through positive interactions and clean transactions. Money is a form of energy that can be used to influence and grow but must be managed responsibly and ethically.
Blockchain and Energy Transactions:
•	In the modern era, blockchain and other emerging technologies allow new ways of interacting and doing business cleanly and transparently. Energy transactions must be fair and beneficial for all parties involved, promoting organic and sustainable growth.

Superpowers and Civilization Wars:
•	Superpowers like the United States, China, Russia, and India are manifestations of extremely powerful astral influences. These superpowers act as large gravitational forces on the super grid, significantly dominating and interacting with other universes. These civilizations are not just nations but conglomerates of universes with similar characteristics that have united in different orbits than ours, creating powerful gravitational forces.
•	The interaction between these superpowers can be seen as a war of civilizations, where super grids collide and reunite, generating new power dynamics. These interactions occur not only in the political and economic realm but also in the energetic and astral realm, reflecting the complexity of relationships between large influences.
•	These wars and conflicts reflect our tendency always to try to reach and dominate new frontiers as if we were chasing divine greatness. In reality, what we perceive as the universe and its galaxies is an illusion created by the interaction of light with the opposite pole. What we see are reflections of light that represent events and structures that exist in a different reality than ours.

19. Mathematical Framework for MPT
Here, we develop an advanced mathematical framework for MPT and include a reverse mathematical proof.

where fff and ggg are continuously differentiable functions:
f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣f(U(x,y), U(x+1,y)) = k \cdot |U(x+1,y) - U(x,y)|f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣ g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))=k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣g(U(x,y), U(x,y+1)) = k \cdot |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)|g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))=k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣


Perceived Time:
T(x,y)=∑i=0xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+∑j=0yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))T(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} f(U(i,y), U(i+1,y)) + \sum_{j=0}^{y} g(U(x,j), U(x,j+1))T(x,y)=i=0∑xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+j=0∑yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))
Perception Function:
P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))P(x,y) = h(CE(x,y))P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))
where hhh is a function dependent on consciousness CCC and energy transitions E(x,y)E(x,y)E(x,y):
h(CE(x,y))=α⋅C⋅E(x,y)h(CE(x,y)) = \alpha \cdot C \cdot E(x,y)h(CE(x,y))=α⋅C⋅E(x,y)
Information Encoding:
I(x,y)=∑i=0xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+∑j=0yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))I(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} f(U(i,y), U(i+1,y)) + \sum_{j=0}^{y} g(U(x,j), U(x,j+1))I(x,y)=i=0∑xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+j=0∑yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))
Perception Function with Observer's Experience:
P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))+β(x,y)P(x,y) = h(CE(x,y)) + \beta(x,y)P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))+β(x,y)
________________________________________
Advanced Mathematical Framework
Here, we present the extended mathematical formulations for a deeper understanding of MPT.
Multiversal Energy Gradient:
∇E(x′,y′)=(∂E∂x′,∂E∂y′)\nabla E(x',y') = \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial x'}, \frac{\partial E}{\partial y'} \right)∇E(x′,y′)=(∂x′∂E,∂y′∂E)
Movement Perception Integral:
M(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)∇E(x′,y′)⋅drM(x,y) = \int_{(x_0, y_0)}^{(x, y)} \nabla E(x', y') \cdot d\mathbf{r}M(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)∇E(x′,y′)⋅dr
Temporal Perception Integral:
T(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)E(x′,y′)⋅drT(x,y) = \int_{(x_0, y_0)}^{(x, y)} E(x', y') \cdot d\mathbf{r}T(x,y)=∫(x0,y0)(x,y)E(x′,y′)⋅dr
________________________________________

Reverse Mathematical Proof
In this section, we reverse-engineer the mathematical framework to validate MPT.
Minimal Expression Approach:
1.	Starting with the Perception Function:
P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))P(x,y) = h(CE(x,y))P(x,y)=h(CE(x,y))
Given h(CE(x,y))=α⋅C⋅E(x,y)h(CE(x,y)) = \alpha \cdot C \cdot E(x,y)h(CE(x,y))=α⋅C⋅E(x,y):
P(x,y)=α⋅C⋅E(x,y)P(x,y) = \alpha \cdot C \cdot E(x,y)P(x,y)=α⋅C⋅E(x,y)
2.	Energy Function and Transitions:
Assuming E(x,y)=f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))+g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))E(x,y) = f(U(x,y), U(x+1,y)) + g(U(x,y), U(x,y+1))E(x,y)=f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))+g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1)):
E(x,y)=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣+k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣E(x,y) = k \cdot |U(x+1,y) - U(x,y)| + k \cdot |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)|E(x,y)=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣+k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣
3.	Perceived Time:
T(x,y)=∑i=0xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+∑j=0yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))T(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} f(U(i,y), U(i+1,y)) + \sum_{j=0}^{y} g(U(x,j), U(x,j+1))T(x,y)=i=0∑xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+j=0∑yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))
Given:
f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣f(U(x,y), U(x+1,y)) = k \cdot |U(x+1,y) - U(x,y)|f(U(x,y),U(x+1,y))=k⋅∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣ g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))=k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣g(U(x,y), U(x,y+1)) = k \cdot |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)|g(U(x,y),U(x,y+1))=k⋅∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣
Therefore:
T(x,y)=k(∑i=0x∣U(i+1,y)−U(i,y)∣+∑j=0y∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣)T(x,y) = k \left( \sum_{i=0}^{x} |U(i+1,y) - U(i,y)| + \sum_{j=0}^{y} |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)| \right)T(x,y)=k(i=0∑x∣U(i+1,y)−U(i,y)∣+j=0∑y∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣)
4.	Information Encoding:
I(x,y)=∑i=0xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+∑j=0yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))I(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} f(U(i,y), U(i+1,y)) + \sum_{j=0}^{y} g(U(x,j), U(x,j+1))I(x,y)=i=0∑xf(U(i,y),U(i+1,y))+j=0∑yg(U(x,j),U(x,j+1))
Thus:
I(x,y)=k(∑i=0x∣U(i+1,y)−U(i,y)∣+∑j=0y∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣)I(x,y) = k \left( \sum_{i=0}^{x} |U(i+1,y) - U(i,y)| + \sum_{j=0}^{y} |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)| \right)I(x,y)=k(i=0∑x∣U(i+1,y)−U(i,y)∣+j=0∑y∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣)
5.	Combining Perception and Information:
From P(x,y)=α⋅C⋅E(x,y)P(x,y) = \alpha \cdot C \cdot E(x,y)P(x,y)=α⋅C⋅E(x,y) and E(x,y)=k(∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣+∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣)E(x,y) = k \left( |U(x+1,y) - U(x,y)| + |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)| \right)E(x,y)=k(∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣+∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣):
P(x,y)=α⋅C⋅k(∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣+∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣)P(x,y) = \alpha \cdot C \cdot k \left( |U(x+1,y) - U(x,y)| + |U(x,y+1) - U(x,y)| \right)P(x,y)=α⋅C⋅k(∣U(x+1,y)−U(x,y)∣+∣U(x,y+1)−U(x,y)∣)
________________________________________
By integrating these formulations and proofs, we validate the core principles of MPT, ensuring mathematical coherence and aligning with the theoretical framework.

Conclusion
The Multiversal Perception Theory (MPT) postulates that time, space, and movement are perceptual phenomena emerging from a static two-dimensional multiversal grid. This speculative but mathematically coherent theory invites rigorous testing and could redefine our understanding of reality. It challenges the notion of free will, suggesting our actions are predetermined within the grid. Aging is proposed to result from oxidative changes rather than time passage, emphasizing the illusory nature of our perceptions. The concept of the past as we understand it could be an illusion, with information transitions driving continuity and present existence.
